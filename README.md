|----|----------|----------|
| 1  | Assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted |          |
| 2  | Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum of two of the labor categories limited to the Development Pool labor categories to develop the prototype as quoted in Attachment C |          |
| 3  | Used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.) |          |
| 4  | Deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used |          |
| 5  | Wrote unit tests for their code |          |
| 6  | Set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider |          |
